# Cerebro Infrastructure Project

## Overview
The Cerebro Infrastructure Project is designed to establish a robust, scalable, and efficient platform for neurological research and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, specifically Terraform, this project aims to automate the creation and management of necessary cloud resources.

## Objective
The primary objective is to provide a stable and secure environment for neurological research and AI development.

## Features
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: Utilize Terraform for consistent and repeatable infrastructure setups.
- **Scalable and Secure Architecture**: Designed to scale resources as needed while ensuring data security and compliance.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Capabilities**: Support for intensive computational tasks, essential for AI and machine learning workloads.
- **Data Storage and Management**: Robust solutions for handling large datasets, including secure data storage options.

## Components
The infrastructure primarily consists of the following components:
- **Amazon EMR Serverless**: For efficient big data processing.
- **EC2 Instances**: Scalable virtual servers for various computational needs.
- **Subnet Configuration**: Properly configured subnets within a VPC for network segmentation and security.
- ... _[other components]_

## Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: An active Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
- **Terraform**: Terraform installed on your local machine.

## Usage
To deploy the infrastructure:
1. **Clone the Repository**
